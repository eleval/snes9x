# Snes9x DKC
*Snes9x - Portable Super Nintendo Entertainment System (TM) emulator*

This is a fork of the Snes9x repository which adds host switching during Netplay of the DKC games when the played character changes, so the game can be played without lag accross long distances.

For the network multiplayer to work properly, both players need to make sure they are using the same port and both have their port forwarded within their router.

Any region of the three DKC game should work. If there is any issue with any of the games, please open an issue and I will look at it.

You can find the official Snes9x repository over at https://github.com/snes9xgit/snes9x.
